ISSUES

- i was having issues displaying a proper memory map; therefore its not correctly displaying
  dirty bits nor the second chance bit
- i feel as though the number of page faults that I was getting was wrong
- genuinely didn't have enough time to work on this project; work and personal issues devoured me
  this past month
- also my project always terminates to do a log file restriction or timer; usually log file
- if project gets stuck, then rerun it; this is due to message queues going to quickly i believe
  and as a result i had to include a while loop so the message would be able to be received; happened
  in my last project too
- memory layout is only displayed once on the terminal and not log file because it takes up too much space
- probably some more issues that i am unaware of but I did not have enough time to debug; lack of sleep
  has also made me quite unaware

HOW TO RUN

1. Type 'make' in the terminal
2. Run as './oss' followed by the options; if no options are specified, then defaults will be provided [-m 18] is default

   e.g. ./oss -s -10

3. Wait for program to finish; it only displays the statistics and the memory layout
4. Type 'make clean' to remove executables, object files, and log file
